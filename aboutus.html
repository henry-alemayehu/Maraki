    <h2> OUR STORY</h2>
    <p> As a result of struggling to find comfortable shoes that fits, MARAKI was founded 10 years ago with a intention to import the world’s best shoes. We launched MARAKI fashion boutique in July 2011 EC after feeling Addis ababa had more to offer its people in terms of retail. We love the buzz of cities with small independent retailers and always support them, where we can. We believe that independent retailers can work together with chain stores to offer people choice. A good mix brings people in and helps people use and enjoy their city.

        MARAKI is situated in the heart of Addis ababa city, adjacent to the recently redeveloped Meskel Square complex, which has already generated a great buzz around town.
        Having a close bond, we love working together and helping our customers during their visit. At MARAKI we have a small but close team. Our girls are very welcoming and are happy to help and chat away while you shop. We think people are most confident when they look their best shoes and accessories play an important role in making them look the part.
        
        We’re offering different ranges, some which can already be found in the city but also introducing new brands to introduce to Addis Ababa to give you choice. Our ranges are stylish and sophisticated. We stock the latest on-trend fashions and our pieces can be worn as, casual, smart-casual or semi-formal.
        <br> <br>Our Stockists include: Meron getachew, Abigail Solomon, Tommas belachew, Jossy belay, Teddy Mekonen, Biniam Temesgen, Tamrat Dereje and Hana Hunachew.  We always try and look for something different!
        
        Customer service is our number one priority and we want our customers to enjoy their experience in our boutique. As well as looking after you we also look after our shoes from the moment they arrive. All stock is checked in a professional manner. Expect your purchase to be neatly wrapped in soft tissue paper.
